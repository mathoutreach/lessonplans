A lesson plan suitable for grades 2-4 which focuses on symmetry.


This lesson plan is designed for about a one-hour long class.

Symmetries:
- what are symmetries?
- A triangle has symmetries; we can rotate it and flip it.
- If we combine a rotation with a flip, we get a different flip.
- Derive the multiplication on the board for the group of symmetries.

From an equilateral triangle, we can make a hexagon.
- What kind of symmetries does it have?
- Make a proper snowflake with hexagonal symmetry (and not the octagonal
  symmetry which is sometimes done!)

Final activity is the present tri-nim, which is a fun game.  As I
recall, there is a winnning strategy that involves symmetry, but I
kind of forget what it is.
